# Simple HTML Notepad

A minimalist, single-file, zero-dependency notepad that runs entirely in your web browser. Edit and save text files locally with no installation, no server, and no fuss.



## ✨ Features

*   **File Operations:** Open and save files directly from your local machine.
*   **Client-Side Only:** Runs 100% in the browser. Your files and data are never sent to a server.
*   **Clean Interface:** A sticky toolbar and a large, editable text area provide a distraction-free writing environment.
*   **Zoom Control:**
    *   Use **Pinch-to-zoom** on touch devices.
    *   Use **`Ctrl` + `Mouse Wheel`** on desktops to adjust the text size.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Quick access to functions with `Alt` key combinations (e.g., `Alt+O` to Open).
*   **Print-Friendly:** When printing, only the text content is visible for a clean paper copy.
*   **Smart Save Versioning:** Automatically decrements a leading number, if present, in the filename for simple versioning (e.g., `999-notes.txt` saves as `998-notes.txt` on the next save).

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Download the `notepad.html` file.
2.  Open it in your favorite web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3.  You're ready to write!
